- 👋 Hi, I’m @alblearning
- 👀 I’m interested in learning UX/UI programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my own website from scratch!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn more about coding. Doesn't have to be related to UX/UI, I am easily intrigued and if you can teach me I want to learn :)
- 📫 How to reach me... can you dm on github???
